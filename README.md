## Structure

```
index.html        # Main HTML file
styles.css        # (Optional) External stylesheet if you separate CSS
app.js            # (Optional) JavaScript logic if you separate JS
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the login page.
3. Modify the HTML/CSS/JS as needed to integrate with your backend.

## Demo Behavior

- The form validates that all fields are filled and password length is at least 6 characters.
- On submit, a simulated login success message appears (replace with real backend integration).
- The "Forgot password?" link triggers an alert to show where reset logic can be implemented.

- Update the validation logic in `app.js` to meet your application's needs.
- Connect the submit handler to your API or backend for real authentication.
